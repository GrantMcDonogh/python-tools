Where chimneys / jet master / extraction ducting penetrates the roof of any thatch building, the chimney, stacks are constructed in such a way that the outer faces in contact with the thatch do 
not become hot.  In normal chimneys, a full brick thickness (220mm) is necessary to satisfy this requirement.  All mortar joints in the stack are properly filled.  Where the chimney stack / jet 
master steel funnel / extraction ducting penetrates the roof plane, this is dressed with a sheet metal or fibreglass reinforced polyester flashing under, between and over the top surface of the 
thatch.  The width of the flashing is at least 250 mm.

A spark arrestor, fitted not less than 700 mm from the top of the stack, is provided in all chimney stacks.  The spark arrestor typically comprises a 10 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm (minimum) section of 
stainless-steel wire mesh across the full width of the flue and securely built into the flue around the edges or supported on mild steel 
dowels.

The chimney flues are cleaned at least annually prior to winter use, by competent persons to avoid an accumulation of soot, which may ignite and generate 
sparks.

The 
effective height of the lightning mast/s is of such a height that it/they provide a shielding angle to the structure/s that it is protecting of a minimum angle of 45 degrees taken from the highest tip 
of the mast to ground zero.  Whether the lightning mast is attached or free standing it is bonded to the earth electrode of the structure or an earth electrode of its own source.  Where metals are 
used in the thatch construction (i.e wire mesh, metal coated insulation, etc).  These are bonded to the earthed metal water main or earth electrode of the 
structure.                                                                                                                                  
Where chimneys and gable ends are present that are not protected by the appropriate shielding in (1) above, i.e. often the chimney extends above the shielding angle of the lightning mast, a 
peripheral conductor is used around the chimney or along the gable and this is connected to a down conductor bonded to the earth electrode or water main.

1.  Chimney penetration / Jet Master / Extraction Ducting                                                                                                                                                                              
Where chimneys / jet master / extraction ducting penetrates the roof of any thatch building, the chimney, stacks are constructed in such a way that the outer faces in contact with the thatch do 
not become hot.  In normal chimneys, a full brick thickness (220mm) is necessary to satisfy this requirement.  All mortar joints in the stack are properly filled.  Where the chimney stack / jet 
master steel funnel / extraction ducting penetrates the roof plane, this is dressed with a sheet metal or fibreglass reinforced polyester flashing under, between and over the top surface of the 
thatch.  The width of the flashing is at least 250 mm.

A spark arrestor, fitted not less than 700 mm from the top of the stack, is provided in all chimney stacks.  The spark arrestor typically comprises a 10 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm (minimum) section of 
stainless-steel wire mesh across the full width of the flue and securely built into the flue around the edges or supported on mild steel 
dowels.                                                                                                                                                         
3.  Cleaning of Chimney Flues

COMMOOIB BURGLAR ALARM WARRANTY - if shown in the schedule to apply
The following burglar alarm warranty is applicable if:
a. theft cover is conditional upon an alarm being fitted, or
b. a discount has been allowed off the premium for the fitting of such an alarm,
c. it is reflected in policy schedule that an alarm has been fitted,
d. it is indicated on the policy schedule that the burglary alarm warranty is applicable,
e. the Insured has indicated in the proposal form that the property is protected by a burglar alarm:
It is a condition precedent to liability that the burglar alarm be professionally installed and supported by an armed response reaction unit to cover the insured premises and it is warranted that:
a. the burglar alarm installed will be made fully operative while the premises is unoccupied. (For the purposes of this warranty the presence of an employee on the insured premises who has not 
been given full authority to activate or de-activate the alarm system and enter and exit that portion of the premises that is protected by such an alarm system, will not be regarded as being 
occupied).
b. loss of or damage to the property, following upon the use of keys, the keypad code or remote control of the burglar alarm or a duplicate thereof belonging to the Insured, unless such keys, 
keypad code or remote control was obtained by violence or threat of violence to the valid holder thereof.
c. the burglar alarm will be maintained in proper working order. However, the Insured is deemed to have discharged liability if the Insured have fulfilled the obligations under a maintenance 
contract with the installation/service company of the alarm system; and
d. a valid and current contract is in force with the alarm service provider, including response by a reaction unit.
If the installed alarm is an approved, certified burglar alarm, the Insurer is entitled to request full information of the relevant activating and de-activating log in the event of a claim.
           or
Where the installed alarm is not an approved, certified burglar alarm,
a. the said alarm must be a dual monitoring alarm. (For the purposes of this requirement, dual monitoring means that once the alarm is triggered, a signal will be transmitted by two different 
methods to the control room of the company monitoring the alarm).
